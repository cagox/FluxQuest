# FluxQuest Design Documents.

This is the start of a real design document for this project. It is also an experiment, to see if placing the documentation in this location is useful. I have named this file README.md to simplify viewing the design docs through github.

I am currently having issues getting GitHub to allow me to upgrade to premium, but once that is worked out, I will set up the wiki instead.

## Discussion

FluxQuest, possibly to be renamed Seeds of Mana, is an RPG that mixes an unusual sort of world building with procedural elements. This makes it fall into the RogueLite category. How much it deviates from that category is yet to be seen.

When the world first spawns, the player will find themselves in a small void. They find a book and a magical sphere. The book gets them started on their journey and the sphere is a tool that helps them control their new world.

The book is a guide book that will grow and gain information as their world grows. Once they are able to open their inventory they will find a few days rations, bedding, a few tools, and a few "Mana Seeds" that they will use to start building their world.

As they build their realm, they will become stronger and gain access to more skills and abilities.

As their world grows, dungeons will spawn that let them gain resources, as well as gaining temporary access to other worlds.

The world will be built up of tiles and plots. New tiles are created by planting "seeds" that cause properties to spread out from the central point to the tiles around them.  When new seeds are planted they can influence tiles that are already in place.
